# versioner
A simple versioning application that takes snapshots of the code in the src/ folder and copies it to the version/$1 folder.

## To-Do
There is still a lot of things to do to make this worth it. Some include:
- [ ] Add new arguments, like:
  - `-o` for output
  - `-v` for version name (in case it is provided later)
  - `-i` for input (the src/ folder)
- [ ] Experiment exporting to C with Cython
